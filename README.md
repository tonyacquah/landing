# landing

This is a simple landing page for a dog tournament. It is inspired by a task in the Odin project at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

There was extensive use of flexboxes for positioning. 

The roboto font was imported from Google fonts and the images used are royalty-free images sourced from unsplash.com.
